## an awful text editor, made in Python
### What is uwuEdit?
uwuEdit is an awful text editor that Veikko wrote at night because who tf sleeps. It has no config file and no customizability. It's as simple of a text editor, that is intended as a school project. You shouldn't use it because it's bad.

### Why are you putting it on github then?
Because we need more uwuTools and easier to distrubute to the teacher.

### How do I use it?
Tkinter is required. The package name is usually `python38-tk`. To run it `python3.8 /path/to/uwuEdit.py`.
