## an awful text editor, made in Python
### What is uwuEdit?
uwuEdit is an awful text editor that Veikko wrote at night because who tf sleeps. It has no config file and no customizability. It's as simple of a text editor, that is intended as a school project. You shouldn't use it because it's bad.

### Why are you putting it on github then?
Because we need more uwuTools and easier to distrubute to the teacher.

### How do I use it?
Python and tkinter are required. To install tkinter, run `pip install tk`. To install uwuEdit run the `install.sh` script. If you want to run it without installing it, run `./uwuEdit`.
